3. Paperless Booking Process: The system addresses the challenge of manual reservation processes, eliminating the need for physical ticketing and reducing the dependency on paper-based systems
4. Efficient flight management: The system should optimize the reservation process and streamline operations for airlines and travel agencies. It should enable efficient management of flight details, passenger information, and reservations
5. Customer satisfaction: The system should contribute to customer satisfaction by providing a user-friendly interface, reliable information, and seamless reservation and booking processes
